# Under Dev phase.
# Purpose:
# This notebook processes real-world VM inventory data (extracted via RVTools and pre-filtered using a Bash script)
# and applies K-Means clustering to dynamically classify each VM into a T-shirt size category (Small, Medium, Large)
# based on its CPU and RAM allocation.
#
# Objective:
# The goal is to enable a scientific and automated classification mechanism to support dynamic pricing models,
# distinguishing between minimum platform commitments and Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) excess consumption.
# This approach is relevant in hybrid infrastructure contexts where resources are provisioned as fixed-capacity (CAPEX),
# but usage fluctuates over time. It allows for continuous-time cost modeling without relying on cloud-native elasticity.
